#Ruby language, GOSU module inheritance

#Gosu is a game development framework that is built with the Ruby language. It provides the use of a game window, game physics, audio, images, animation, and 60 FPS with its built-in Gosu update method.

#Ruby language has to be installed if using windows, mac has ruby pre-installed. Gosu gem can be downloaded through mac terminal along with the other gems needed to play this game. (homebrew gem, chipmunk, gosu etc). 

#As you go on through the levels by defeating bosses, different stronger bosses will spawn with different landscapes and more monsters will spawn and will be increasingly harder as well. Tapping game w/ RPG elements are being used with different spells and upgrading weapons.

#An .exe of the game is attached to this repo as well! :)

#Final Product (for now). I may remake this in GML and GameMaker Studio 2.
