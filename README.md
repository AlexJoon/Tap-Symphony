#State of the game, rough cut, fewish hours in from scratch

#Ruby language, GOSU module inheritance

#Ruby language has to be installed if using windows, mac has ruby pre-installed. Gosu gem can be downloaded through mac terminal along with the other gems needed to play this game. (homebrew gem, chipmunk, gosu etc). 

#As you go on through the levels by defeating bosses, different stronger bosses will spawn with different landscapes. More mechanics are going to be added on later and alot more!
