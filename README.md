#Ruby language, GOSU module inheritance

#Ruby language has to be installed if using windows, mac has ruby pre-installed. Gosu gem can be downloaded through mac terminal along with the other gems needed to play this game. (homebrew gem, chipmunk, gosu etc). 

#As you go on through the levels by defeating bosses, different stronger bosses will spawn with different landscapes. 

#Final Product (for now). I may remake this in GML and GameMaker Studio 2.
